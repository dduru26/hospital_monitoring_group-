Our group we created a hospital Monitoring System. This system is incharge of optimizing data handling and improve patient monitoring.

We started by creating a repository  and cloning it to our github
Then we first created a README.md file which is talking about our task then 3 scripts were created which include 
1. **Heart Rate Monitoring Script** (`heart_rate_monitor.sh`): Records heart rate data from specified devices at one-second intervals.
2. **Log Archival Script** (`archive_log.sh`): Archives the heart rate log file by renaming it with a timestamp.
3. **Backup Script** (`backup_archives.sh`): Moves archived log files to a designated directory and backs them up to a remote server via SSH. 
 As we moved forward we runned our codes to see whether they were running and executing as the rubric said.
